I am here. I exist. I'm your daughter, the one you gave birth to. But I guess I'm not here in the moment to you. You care more about my grades than my own health. All you both do is scream at each other while I try to find a better way to silence the yells. I cover my ears, I close my eyes while your roars are getting louder and louder and the next thing I notice - I'm in a soaked, salty pillow of tears while staring at the popcorn ceiling of a place, so-called home, but since when does home mean fear and children thinking what families would be if parents didn't fall out of love? I think about all the happy families of my classmates and say that's not fair. I wake up all alone with both of my parents gone. I feel such ease, because the only time you hear our 'home' so silent is from 4am to 5pm. I go and make myself cereal while my mind is racing with a hundred different thoughts and then it hits me again... the feeling of knowing that my parents, who swore to love each other til the day they'll have to say goodbye, was all just a big huge lie.
