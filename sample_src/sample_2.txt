Hello there, You may never read this, but you're just the most amazing thing that has happened to me. From the way you smile at me to the way you held my hand and dragged me into the train before the doors closed. Something about all those little interactions made my heart jump and the butterflies in my stomach start dancing. You waited for me even when everyone left, it just makes my heart melt whenever I see you there. Though there were days where you would remain silent or act coldly to me, I would not mind. You have your bad days and I understand that. It worries me sometimes when you do that, maybe its cause I have a habit of overthinking, but I fear you have started disliking me or are getting sick of me. I have become so attached to you, I don't think I can let go of you so easily. Sometimes you come over and rant to me about your troubles and I do my best to give you advice, but it all seems useless to me. They never seem to help and often worsen the situation. Nonetheless, I try to make the best of everything no matter the outcome, but I hope one I can be helpful to you. 2020 is coming to an end and itâ€™s been a year since the day we started walking home together. I wish and pray we never separate and continue walking home together.
