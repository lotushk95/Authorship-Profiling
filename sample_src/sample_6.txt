Check up on your "happy" friend, please. On the outside they may look happy, but on the inside, they might be suffering. Now, I don't mean this as a joke or to be funny, they are suffering because nobody checks on them, nobody asks how they are or if they need to talk. They're simply going through the motions pretending everything is perfect because they've been doing it for so fucking long you can't even tell the difference. Check up on your "happy" friend, please. They can say that those cuts were their cat and you can believe them and won't think anything more about it. You can't even tell that they made them, rather than their cat. Why? because they're the happy friend, never sad or depressed and always happy and smiling. Check up on your "happy" friend, please. They hurt themselves and tell themselves they don't belong, but you don't see that, because they're the happy friend. They are happy at school and when you see them, but what you don't see is the crying, the hair pulling, the binging, the purging, the suicide attempts. You never think of them like that, they're happy. Check up on your "happy" friend please.
