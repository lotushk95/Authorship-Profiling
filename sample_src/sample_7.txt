I’ve been counting days, worrying that you might not remember me. Shaking and floating in my imagination. I don’t trust my instincts and don’t believe in myself. I really do believe I’m easy to forget. I thought our connection bothered you. Now I see, my inner ness is letting you go, it’s becoming normal. But each time you game me strength and resistance. So dumb I never expressed and even called you “bro”. Everyone talks about returning to normal life, we should try to make the world a better place. Something outside the gates and from another world tells me you are there and I should trust it. We will keep content and this page of life will be out of our inner chains.
