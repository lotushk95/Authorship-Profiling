I miss you a lot. Like, a lot, lot. It feels like forever since we've last talked and it's a bit sad, really. You know, I always thought you and I were going to be friends forever. I thought, one day, I'd see you again and I would feel so happy that all I could do is run and jump to hug you. I can't even imagine being in the same room as you anymore. I'm sorry I was a terrible friend. I was controlling; I'll admit to that. I 'm not going to try and justify that by saying, "I just wanted the best for you." It'd be wrong to try and shift blame. One thing you need to know, though, is that I really did love you... as much as anyone like me could possibly love someone. You were a great friend and you most certainly deserved better. There's no point in me rambling about the past so I'll end it at this; I hope you're doing fine. I hope you've finally gotten along with your mom and you're all one big happy family. I hope you no longer wake up at 3am to cry, and, if you do, that you have someone to lean on. I hope your younger sister's doing great; I know that, with you, she'll most definitely be loved. I hope the hurt that you've felt before, you'll never feel again. You deserve nothing less than great. I hope you know that. Even if I no longer get to be a part of yours, I hope life is treating you well. Take care of yourself. I love you.
