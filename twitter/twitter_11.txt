What's up bro. How's going? It's been a while since we graduated from the high school so I wanted to catch up with you. FYI, I got gf and wbu? I'm pretty sure you don't get yet. jk lmao Anyway, iit seems like you have good time to "study" in the uni, so keep going on. Tbh, American uni is kinda sucks, especially, for studying. We literally learned what I learned in the high. That was ridiculous. Anyway, let me hear your tea and let's keep in touch bro. See ya.
